    "# 📊 Final Project Summary: Credit Risk Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔎 Problem Statement\n",
    "Financial institutions need reliable methods to assess loan applicants and predict default risk.  \n",
    "This project builds a machine learning model to classify whether a loan should be approved or rejected based on applicant and loan features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📂 Dataset Explanation\n",
    "- **Features**: Age, Gender, Education, Income, Employment Experience, Home Ownership, Loan Amount, Loan Intent, Loan Interest Rate, Loan Percent Income, Credit History Length, Credit Score, Previous Defaults, Debt-to-Income Ratio, Age Group.  \n",
    "- **Target**: Loan Status (Approved = 1, Not Approved = 0).  \n",
    "- **Source**: Publicly available credit risk datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "- Missing values handled with imputation (mean/median for numeric, mode for categorical).  \n",
    "- Categorical variables encoded (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding).  \n",
    "- Numerical features scaled for consistency.  \n",
    "- Train-test split applied (e.g., 80/20).  \n",
    "- Addressed class imbalance with SMOTE / class weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Visualizations\n",
    "- Distribution plots for income, credit score, loan amount.  \n",
    "- Correlation heatmap to identify feature relationships.  \n",
    "- Loan approval rates segmented by education, gender, home ownership.  \n",
    "- ROC curves and confusion matrices for model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🌐 Deployment Details\n",
    "- **Backend**: FastAPI hosted on Hugging Face Spaces  \n",
    "  - Endpoint: `/predict`  \n",
    "  - Docs: [Swagger UI](https://sujith2121-credit-risk-assessment-fastapi.hf.space/docs)  \n",
    "- **Frontend**: Streamlit hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud  \n",
    "  - App: [Credit Risk Assessment Streamlit](https://credit-risk-assessment-stream.streamlit.app/)  \n",
    "- **Note**: Both services are on free tiers, so they may **go to sleep when idle** and take a few seconds to wake up.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 Learning Outcomes\n",
    "- Learned how to preprocess and balance real-world credit datasets.  \n",
    "- Compared multiple ML algorithms and tuned hyperparameters.  \n",
    "- Understood trade-offs between accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  \n",
    "- Built and deployed a full-stack ML solution (FastAPI backend + Streamlit frontend).  \n",
    "- Gained experience with Dockerization, Hugging Face Spaces, and Streamlit Cloud deployment.\n",

    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Challenges Faced \n",
    "- Choosing appropriate evaluation metrics beyond accuracy.  \n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning for ensemble methods.  \n",
    "- Deployment quirks (Hugging Face requires port 7860, Streamlit apps sleep when idle).  \n",
    "- Ensuring reproducibility and smooth integration between backend and frontend.\n",
